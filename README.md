# Qiskit Fall Fest '22 at RV PU

Hello and welcome!

We're excited to announce the Qiskit Fall Fest at RV PU on Sunday, 30 October 2022. 
Quantum computing is an overlooked career path as it contains a lot of initial roadblocks of high-level math, incomprehensible metaphors and excessive jargon. But at Qiskit Fall Fest '22, we aim to demystify hand-wavy metaphors used in pop science to describe quantum computing and give you a complete overview on the fascinating field of the future.
Get a chance to win amazing IBM swag packs as a part of our final quiz! Certificates will also be issued to all participants.

More information to be updated soon. Stay tuned!
