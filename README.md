# Qiskit Fall Fest '22 at RV PU

Hello and welcome!

Quantum computing is an overlooked career path as it contains a lot of initial roadblocks of high-level math, incomprehensible metaphors and excessive jargon. But at Qiskit Fall Fest '22, we aim to demystify hand-wavy metaphors used in pop science to describe quantum computing, and instead give you a complete science-based overview on the fascinating field of the future.
Get a chance to win amazing IBM swag packs as a part of our final quiz! Certificates will also be issued to all participants.
